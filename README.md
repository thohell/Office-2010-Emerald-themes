# Microsoft Office 2010 themes for Emerald
I really like the theme used by the Microsoft Office 2010 applications. Since I'm on Linux, I thought I'd make them stick out less by integrating them better in the environment. The obvious solution was to write window decorations to match the theme of the office applications.

These three themes are for the Emerald window manager. _(I actually used Smaragd for KWin when I wrote these, but as they are fairly basic themes they should work equally well using regular Emerald)_

## Install
Just download the theme you like and import the file using Emerald Theme Manager. Done!
